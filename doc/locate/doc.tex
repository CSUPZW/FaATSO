\begin{abstract}
This document presents an implementation of a least $\ell_1$-norm event location method in heterogeneous 3D, anisotropic media. The method uses computations of arrival times throughout the material with the fast marching method and a grid-search approach to obtain locations. The origin time is obtained from the median of the $\ell_1$-norm of the differences between observed and computed arrival time.
